========================

A Chrome extension that integrates directly with IMDb to help you find movies and TV shows on alternative streaming services and torrent trackers.

## Features

-   **Seamless IMDb Integration**: Adds "Find on Rezka" and "Find on Torrent" buttons directly to the IMDb movie page (below the "Add to Watchlist" button) to open a new tab with the search results on the selected website.
-   **Full Control on Popup**:
    -   **Toggle Functionality**: Independently enable or disable the Rezka or Torrent buttons via the popup if you only need one of them.
    -   **Rezka Mirror**: Select from a list of Rezka mirrors (e.g., `rezka.ag`, `hdrezka.tv`).
    -   **Torrent Tracker**: Select your preferred torrent tracker (e.g., `toloka.to`, `rutracker.org`).
    -   **Edit Lists**: Easily add or remove domains of both buttons to keep up with active links.
